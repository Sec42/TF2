This is a cgi to check steam IDs vs. the UGC database to see 
which teams they play(ed) in. Intended use is to check for mercs
on the opposing team quickly before a match.

It supports pasting "status" output, or fetching it via rcon
if you supply server/password.

You will need the folloing non-standard perl modules :
- Rcon::HL2 from CPAN
- GET from <https://github.com/Sec42/Scripts/tree/master/GET>

Have fun,
  Sec
